# Amazon Review Framework API

A comprehensive system for creating EXCeptional product reviews to qualify for the Amazon Vine program.

## Overview

This API provides access to the Amazon Review Framework, a structured system designed to help reviewers create high-quality, engaging product reviews. The framework consists of multiple JSON components that work together to guide the review process from information gathering to final polish.

The platform includes both a REST API and an interactive Gradio interface that uses Anthropic's Claude model to generate reviews based on user input and the framework components.

## Framework Components

The framework consists of the following key components:

- **framework-config.json**: Core configuration and workflow
- **review-strategy.json**: Strategic goals and principles
- **question-framework.json**: Strategic questioning methodology
- **product-analysis.json**: Product testing frameworks
- **image-analysis.json**: Image assessment guidelines
- **content-structure.json**: Section organization templates
- **keyword-strategy.json**: Search optimization approach
- **writing-process.json**: Content creation workflow
- **personality-balance.json**: Information/personality ratios
- **personality-techniques.json**: Humor & creative techniques
- **thematic-frameworks.json**: Theme development frameworks
- **narrative-sensory.json**: Storytelling & sensory frameworks
- **quality-assessment.json**: Quality evaluation criteria
- **redundancy-verification.json**: Duplication prevention
- **examples-templates.json**: Implementation examples
